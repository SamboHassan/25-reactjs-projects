    <p>My <em>favorite</em> character from <i>Sesame Street</i> is Grover.</p>

    <h1><strong>Warning!</strong> Do not be late</h1>
    <h2><strong>Chocolate and Coffee</strong> and other things I crave</h2>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph of text. Let’s pretend it’s part of a long article, where we expect many people to quickly scan
        through it, and <b>we want to mark certain phrases with some boldness</b>, some visual attention, so that those
        sentences jump out and people don’t miss them. Almost like having a pull-quote.</p>
